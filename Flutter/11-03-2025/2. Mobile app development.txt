1. Smart phones: Android and IOS 
Android --> SDK --> Kotlin/Java ---> (Native android application)
IOS --> SDK --> Objective C/ Swift --> (Native android application)


Advantages:
	Works faster and efficient 
	UI/loyout would be platform specific 
	Native features can be developed easily

Disadvantages:
	For each platform a specific applicaton need to be developed
	Time and resource consuming

Hybrid / Cross platform mobile application development 

Idea is: 
	We will develop UI/Layout using a common language 
	(in most availavle fw we use html/css/js/ts) some langauges also bring in their own 	application 
	
	We can still native features according to the platforms by converting the valls in 	the source code to native calls


	One codde --> multiple platforms
	
	Ionic:
	React Native

	Flutter - Cross platform Application 
		1. cross platfor mobile app
		2. web app 
		3. Desktop application

	Flutter uses a language called dart for development 

	What we going to do?

	Using flutter how to develop cross platforms mobile applications / android 	applications

	For making / testing application for android 
	we need andoid device 
	
	Adroid device 
		Emulator(AVD)

	Emulator ? SDK and emulator tools


Note: We are not going to develop anything using android studio 

Google doesn't allow downloading SDK without studio
