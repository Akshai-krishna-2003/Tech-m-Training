When we click on an item we want to highlight it 

so we have a class in css bootstrap called active 
// active is a class to activate highlight className="list-group-item active" this will activate all the items and its not what we want to have


import { useState } from "react";

function GetList() {
  let items = ["New York", "Chennai", "Mumbai", "Delhi"];

  // Click not working so why it happens
  // Because selectedIndex is local to
  //   let selectedIndex = 0;
  // onClick={() => (selectedIndex = index)} IN li
  // React is not aware of this variable
  // To tell react we have have a DATA or STATE that might CHANGE OVER TIME
  // To use this we are goinng to use a function called useState

  // This function is called a Hook
  // Hook is a function that allows us to tap into built in features in react
  // This is called a STATE HOOK -- There are many hooks too
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(-1); // this returns an array of two values And
  // arr[0] ==> selected variable like selectedIndex which is current state
  // arr[1] ==> function that updates the present state
  // selectedIndex be a state and setSelectedIndex be a function and we can use this convention in js (Destructuring array in js)
  //   onClick={() => {
  //     setSelectedIndex(index);
  //   }}

  return (
    <>
      <h1>List</h1>

      <ul className="list-group">
        {/*Index of the item can be used using index */}
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li
            // active is a class to activate highlight className="list-group-item active" this will activate all the items and its not what we want to render
            className={
              selectedIndex === index //  we need to update the index too now
                ? "list-group-item active"
                : "list-group-item"
            }
            key={item}
            onClick={() => {
              setSelectedIndex(index);
            }}
          >
            {" "}
            {/* class name added to make each item clickable*/}
            The city is {item}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export default GetList;


NOTE: Each component will have its own state
