React js - Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces

Why react?
it helps to manage the dom structure of a page 

Create react app:

Two ways - 
1. Create React App (Given by official react team)
2. Vite (Lets use this coz faster and smaller bundle)

Creating a react project 

Command: 
npm create vite@4.1.0

Then do all the requirements asked 
Then select react
select typescript

then cd into the folder 
Then type command 

command: npm i (To install third party dependencies)

open the project in vscode 
Either through GUI 
Commmand is: code .

Then open terminal that is embeddded in vs code

To run web server type: npm run dev

A local host link will be provided 

Key components of files and folders in the project: 

1. node_modules --> All the important modules and all resides here (Donot disturb this folder)
2. public --> Contains all public assets like images and video files etc  
3. See the srcc folder 
It has a component called App.tsx
(Dont worry for now we re write everything from scratch)

Go to index.html you can see this 
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>

This is the entry point of your react application 

package.json -> Information about the project

tsconfig.json -> tells app how to convert ts to js 

vite.config.ts -> Dont need to touch it though it is vite configuration
