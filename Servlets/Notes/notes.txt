Servlet -> It is a java file that can take request 
Process it and create a html page and give back to the client 

Request are given to web container (helper application) (Eg. tomcat)

client (req abc.html) -> helper application (has a file named deployment descriptor (web.xml))  -> servlet

deployment descriptor -> is a mapper that says for which request which servlet has to be called 
(file name is web.xml)

2 tags 
servlet tag -> class name
servlet mapping tag -> url patterns 

servlet -> class extends HttpServlet

servlet makes response (in form of html, string, xml or whatever)

response go from server to client machine in form of response object  

We can use annotations -> to avoid xml files 

Workspace -> Folder where u put  all your project
