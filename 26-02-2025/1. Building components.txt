Creating a list group component

Before that, lets install Bootstrap 
It is a popular CSS library that gives us a bunch of CSS classes for styling our application

command to install npm i bootstrap@5.2.3 

contents of App.css is removed 
And contents index.css is removed completely

import this in main.tsx
'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

Lets create a list group component

in src folder add a folder named components 

This is not necessary but by convention we put all the components in a folder named components

Get list group from boot strap website from docs  section

This is the code: 
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">An item</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">A second item</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">A third item</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">A fourth item</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">And a fifth one</li>
</ul>

Change the class to className as it is used in js
